## Completed Work

### Infrastructure Setup (2025-07-21)
- **Branch**: `setup/claude-autonomous-workflow`
- **Commits**: (Will be updated as commits are made)
- **Work Completed**:
  - Analyzed codebase structure and architecture
  - Created initial CLAUDE.md with project overview
  - Established docs/claude-work/ working directory
  - Defined comprehensive working standards document

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Complete Infrastructure Setup** (Current Session)
   - Finish creating all required working documents
   - Validate documentation completeness 
   - Commit setup work to feature branch
   - Consider merging infrastructure changes to master

2. **Ready for Product Work** (Next Session)
   - Review working infrastructure
   - Await product requirements or feature requests
   - Begin autonomous feature development using established workflow

## Current Context

### What's Working Well
- Please build system is installed and functional
- Repository has clean git status on master
- Comprehensive understanding of Puku's architecture established
- Clear working standards defined

### Current Environment
- **Repository**: `/home/sfolorunsho/projects/puku`
- **Build System**: Please (`plz` command available)
- **Main Language**: Go 1.23
- **Testing**: `plz test //...`
- **Building**: `plz build //...`

### Key Files Modified This Session
- Created: `CLAUDE.md` (project overview)
- Created: `docs/claude-work/WORKING-STANDARDS.md`
- Created: `docs/claude-work/PROGRESS-TRACKER.md` (this file)

## Blockers and Questions

**Current Blockers**: None

**Pending Decisions**: None at this time

**Questions for Next Session**: None - setup phase

## Session Notes

### Architecture Insights Discovered
- Puku is a BUILD file maintenance tool for Go projects using Please build system
- Core components: generate/, edit/, config/, sync/, migrate/, watch/, work/
- Uses hierarchical puku.json configuration files
- Supports custom build rule types and dependency resolution
- Has comprehensive test suite with E2E testing

### Key Patterns Observed
- Each Go package has its own BUILD file
- Uses Please build system conventions throughout
- Test files co-located with source files
- Third-party dependencies managed in third_party/go/
- Configuration system supports package-level overrides

### Development Environment Status
- Please build system functional
- All basic commands available (build, test)
- Repository in clean state
- Feature branch created for infrastructure work

## Context for Resuming Work

**If resuming this session**: Continue with creating remaining working documents (CODEBASE-KNOWLEDGE.md, DEVELOPMENT-PROCESS.md), then validate and commit setup work.

**If starting new session**: Review all files in docs/claude-work/ for complete context, check git branch status, and proceed with next planned work or await new requirements.

**Current branch status**: On `setup/claude-autonomous-workflow` with infrastructure setup in progress.

**Last updated**: 2025-07-21 during initial setup session
